# Emoji Language Research Project

## Overview

This project investigates whether emojis are emerging as a new form of language in digital communication. Through comprehensive literature review, data collection, exploratory analysis, and machine learning techniques, we examined the structural, functional, and usage patterns of emojis across digital platforms.

## Key Findings

- Emojis exhibit some language-like properties, including functional differentiation, combinatorial patterns, and conventional usage
- The classification model achieved perfect accuracy (1.00) in predicting emoji usage contexts
- Clustering analysis identified distinct functional categories of emojis that parallel word classes in natural languages
- Rather than constituting a full-fledged language, emojis represent a complementary communication system that enhances text-based digital communication

## Usage

### Viewing the Research Report

The comprehensive research report can be found in `reports/emoji_language_research_report.md`. This document provides a detailed analysis of whether emojis are emerging as a new form of language in digital communication.

### Exploring the Interactive Dashboard

To view the interactive dashboard:

1. Open `visualization/dashboard/index.html` in a web browser
2. Explore the various charts and visualizations of emoji usage patterns
3. Review the key findings and conclusions

### Running the Analysis Scripts

To run the analysis scripts:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk emoji statsmodels`
3. Run the exploratory data analysis: `python analysis/emoji_eda.py`
4. Run the machine learning analysis: `python analysis/emoji_ml.py`

### Collecting Additional Data

To collect additional emoji data:

1. Run the Unicode data collector: `python data/unicode_data_collector.py`
2. Run the Twitter data collector: `python data/twitter_data_collector.py`
3. Process the collected data: `python data/emoji_data_processor.py`

## Conclusion

Our research concludes that emojis exhibit some language-like properties but do not constitute a full-fledged language. Instead, they represent an evolving complementary communication system that enhances text-based digital communication by adding emotional context, referential clarity, and expressive nuance.

This hybrid system of text plus emojis represents a novel form of multimodal communication that is uniquely adapted to digital contexts and continues to evolve as digital communication practices change.
